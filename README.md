# DataScience-Modeling
Practice in Python focused on data science principles like modeling, machine-learning, statistics etc. Problems/Scenarios are taken from Dr. Paul Ginsparg.

1. **Election Results**: Using given data about voting states, this model uses margins to predict the likelihoods of certain outcomes in the 2016 election. The ElectionResultsModeling.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook version) or ElectionResultsModeling.py takes in data from election_data.py to make predictions and create a visual representation of these predictions.

2. **Visualizing Spreadsheet Data**: Using given data (cdc0.tsv, cdc1.tsv) about mortality across several ages, races, and genders, the VisualizingSpreadsheetData.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook version) or VisualizingSpreadsheetData.py accesses and manipulates a specific subset to visualize life expectancy for non-hispanic white men and women.
